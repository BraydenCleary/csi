# Brayden Bradfield CSI

My goals for the program:
- Become a more compentant and confident backend engineer
    - What does this mean?
        - Deeply understand the tools I use
        - Deeply understand performance tradeoffs when solving problems
        - Become fluent with the language/vocab necessary to ask and answer good questions
        - Become a toolchain contributor rather than just a toolchain user
- Learn C and GO
    - I've taken two short tabs at learning C but want to add two statically typed systems languages to my toolkit.
    - Take this knowledge back to Python and Ruby to become a better programmer there
- Connect with others who are on this journey
    - I think I've been a bit hesitant to reach out to others in these classes and I'd like to take a different approach this time
    - I'm here to learn with others, so I'm going to make an effort to get to know them
- Figure out 3 job areas I'm interested in exploring
    - Did you enjoy the distributed systems module? What about it did you enjoy? Use your resources to figure out a job that leverages the area that you found interesting
