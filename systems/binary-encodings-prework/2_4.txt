What is the sum of the following two signed integers? Does this match your expectations?

0b01111111
0b10000000+
----------
0b11111111 == -1

How do you negate a number in two’s complement? How can we compute subtraction of two’s complement numbers?

Maybe you negate by flipping all the bits and adding 1?

I didn't get the second part of this but you can negate the second arg and add it to the first in order to subtract...super cool.
