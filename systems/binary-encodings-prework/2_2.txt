Add these two binary numbers and determine the result by doing the addition “in binary”. Convert each number and check that the result matches your expectation.

0b11111111 + 0b00001101 = 0b100001100
255 + 13 == 256 + 12 == 268

If my registers are only 8 bits wide, what is the value returned from that binary addition? What is this phenomenon called?

The value returned from the above binary addition would be 0b00001100...this is called overflow...the true value of my addition can't be represented in 1 byte and we ended up overflowing.
